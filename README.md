# Python Slotmachine
This is a simple python code that let's you deposit an amount, choose the number of betting lines you want to bet on then spins the slot machine using the random module and gives you the lines of the slot machine and the amount of money you won.

## Disclaimer ⚠️
This project is still under developpement.
I don't motivate people to gamble, this was made for fun only.

### How to use
Simply have python installed, and no modules are required (for now) because the random module is pre-installed with python.
* Install python
* Clone the main.py file or download the ZIP format
* Go to your terminal where the file is stored
* Run it using "python main.py"
